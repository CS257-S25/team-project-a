		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, women have had a growing presence in the prison system, largely for drug-related offenses.  Few interventions are geared towards reentering female offenders, for whom HIV and drug use are intimately tied to risky relationships and thinking errors surrounding criminal activity and risky behavior.  This study aimed to develop a manual-driven intervention for the criminal justice system geared towards female drug abusers, specifically reducing HIV risk behavior. Using focus groups to develop the manual, interventionists were then trained and supervised.  The intervention focused on reducing risky behavior through cognitive restructuring and the relationship model.  The intervention takes place through a two-group design, one with three community reentry sessions, the other without reentry sessions. Outcomes of the study were to develop a manual for women reentering society, to contribute to the literature on the unique factors affecting women and risky behavior, to expand on the existing knowledge of the issues faced by reentering women, and to offer information about the connection between community-based reentry resources and the criminal justice system.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> This study is intended to develop a manual-driven intervention for reentering female drug-users, and to test the effectiveness of cognitive restructuring in reducing risky behavior.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> A draft intervention manual was developed and pilot tested on a small focus group.  Revisions were then made to the manual.  Next, interventionists were trained.  The intervention was issued in three phases to one group, while another group was not issued the treatment as a control.  The three community reentry sessions were administered followed by survey collections at the baseline, after one month, and after three months.  Finally, the data collected was used to evaluate and improve the manualized intervention.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> For this study 150 incarcerated women, community women, prison treatment providers, community treatment providers, and community correctional supervisors participated in the focus groups that developed the manual, and 120 female prisoners were recruited to participate in evaluating the intervention, 80 in the experimental group, 40 in the control.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Women in post-release integration.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> <p>individual</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> <p>experimental data, survey data</p></div>
								<div><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> <p>face-to-face interview</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> The variables for the study examine risky sexual behaviors and risky drug abuse behaviors (NIDA RBA), as well as demographic characteristics and self-reports of outcomes.</span></p>
