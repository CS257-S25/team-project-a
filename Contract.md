# Goals
To learn how to design a website (a cool website!)  
Have interesting results that we can draw from a data set and have users be able to see those results!

# Strengths
Sorting data sets - Alex  
Github - Alex  
Worked using HTML and CSS at some basic levels - Newton 
Good at spotting errors in code - Andrew

# Roles
(These roles will not be permanent, they just exist and can be changed)  
Scribe - Writes code - Alex  
Bug Finder - Finds and points out bugs, anyone can fix them - Newton 
Brainstormer - Devises and plans out new ways the code could function
Tester - Uses a virtual environment to test methods - Andrew

# Rules
* Be a kind courteous team player.  
* Respond to messages in a timely manner.  
* Finish everything within the deadline.

## Meetings
Monday/Wednesday = 3-4pm  
Friday = 10-12pm

## Communication
We can communicate via I-message. I feel like respect  
can generally just be pronoun awareness or maybe a first name basis when  
addressing each other, maybe gentle reminders of due dates whether team or individual.  
I know you can @ people in ios texting so that can get attention pretty easily in a  
pretty neutral way I feel. Checking in should really only be necessary when someone  
deems it necessary, like when no progress would affect their progress.  

## Technologies
* I-message  
* GitHub  
* Email  

## Decision-Making
Decision making should be done via general consensus, if someone has
an idea they can just suggest it and then we can vote.

## Delegation
Work should be divided evenly and everyone should receive a meaningful task at any given time,  
we should value product over time spent on product, unless obviously this product isn't produced by people.


## Conflict Resolution
First spam at them via messages.  
Then if there is no response, contact the professor.
